# Advanced-Numerical-Analysis-Project

#### Acoustic Wave modeling.

In this project, I modeled several mathematical algorithms in Python in order to recreate and predict the behavior of
sound waves in an organ’s pipe. I analyzed the effects of pressure of air and length of a pipe on the wave’s behavior using partial differential equations. I used a Jupyter Notebook to develop this project from scratch, so feel free to leave any feedback.

Enjoy!
